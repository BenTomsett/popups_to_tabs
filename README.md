# popups_to_tabs
Chrome extension that opens popups that would normally open in a new window in a new tab instead.

## Installation
Clone the repository (or download as ZIP), go to `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, click 'Load unpacked' and find the folder with the extension in it.

You'll need to keep this folder in the same place, if the folder is deleted the plugin will be removed from Chrome on the next reload.
